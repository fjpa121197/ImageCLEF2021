## ImageCLEF2021

This is repository for the [ImageCLEFmed concept detection task (2021 edition)](https://www.imageclef.org/2021/medical/caption). All code and methods were run using Google Colab Notebooks. 

Two approaches were used for making predictions: Information Retrieval and Multi-label classification. You can find the Google Colab Notebooks used for each approach with their respective folder. Also, any models generated from training can be found within those folders.

## The contents of this repository are the following:
- Information_Retrieval_Approach: folder containing the material related to the IR approach (please refer to the readme within it).
- Multi_label_classification: folder containing the material related to the MLC approach (please refer to the readme within it).
- ImageCLEF2021_Submissions_Notebook: Google Colab Notebook used for generating the submission files (uploaded to AIcrowd).

Images are stored in a Kaggle repository, but credentials for downloading the data has been omitted since the ownership of it is not ours.
