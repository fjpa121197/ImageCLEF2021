# ImageCLEF2021

This is repository for the ImageCLEFmed concept detection task (2021 edition). As stated before, if you are about to test a new experiment from the existing approaches, please create a new branch and work from it. Make sure that the code and results are reproduceable, and if everything works as expected and it is considered as the best results, merge it into the master branch and DO NOT delete the experiment branch.

If a new approach is being developed, create a new branch and also a new directory to identify that is a new approach.
