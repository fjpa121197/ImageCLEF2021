# ImageCLEF2021

This is repository for the ImageCLEFmed concept detection task (2021 edition). All code and methods were run using Google Colab Notebooks. 

Two approaches were used for making predictions: Information Retrieval and Multi-label classification. You can find the Google Colab Notebooks used for each approach with their respective folder. Also, any models generated from training can be found within those folders.

Images are stored in a Kaggle repository, but credentials for downloading the data has been omitted since the ownership of it is not ours.
